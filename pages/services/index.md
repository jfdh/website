title: Our services
description: Create your ASBL/VZW association online. No paperwork.
---

Our goal is to provide services to all initiatives happening in Brussels to make their life easier.

Like the Internet, a city is a public infrastructure on top of which people are invited to contribute.
Making things happen in Brussels today feels like creating a website in 1990. It requires too much work and not everybody has the time nor energy to do it (remember when we had to set up our own web server to host a website?).

Luckily, over the years, it became easier and easier to publish online. We got there by open sourcing the technologies that we all needed so that we could stop wasting time reinventing the wheel and focus instead on our unique contribution to the world.

That's why our goal is to open source all the things that can be open sourced and mutualized all the things that can be mutualized to reduce the friction that exists to create, maintain and operate an association in Brussels.

## Create your association online

As soon as you need to deal with money, you have to create an association (ASBL/VZW). Let's be honest, this is a pain in the ass.
You need to create statuses (in French or Dutch!) and do the accounting. Plus reports that you need to send every year (or every quarter if you are subject to VAT). So much overhead for just throwing up events or doing some local actions here and there. Not to mention that this is something that each and every single association has to go through. So much energy wasted.

BrusselsTogether allows you to create a virtual association online.

### How does it work?

Here is an example of a collective: https://opencollective.com/VeganizerBXL (see the list of [all the collectives hosted by BrusselsTogether](https://opencollective.com/BrusselsTogether#collectives)).

People can donate with their credit card or become a member (or "a friend of the collective") with a monthly or yearly donation.
Companies can also become sponsors. They will automatically receive an invoice.

Anyone can submit an expense or an invoice to the collective. Once approved by one of the administrators (the core contributors of the collective), they get reimbursed via PayPal or by bank transfer.

Everybody can see in full transparency how much money there is in the collective and how it is spent. It gives trust to the community to support your collective.

### How to apply?

- [Fill in this form](https://opencollective.com/BrusselsTogether/apply)

We will review it as soon as possible (usually takes a day or two)

### How much does it cost?

- BrusselsTogether is a non profit (ASBL). To cover our costs we decided together to charge 10%. The "profit" goes into a common participatory budget where we can all decide how to reinvest that money to improve the community. The more collectives we will be, the cheaper it will be for all of us (and we could lower that commission over time). You can [follow our budget in full transparency here](https://opencollective.com/brusselstogether).
- If you are raising money online:
  - there is an additional credit card processing fee (1.9% + â‚¬0.25 per transaction)
  - there is a 5% crowdfunding fee (included in the 10%) that goes to the Open Collective Platform (which is [open source](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective)).
- You can't hire employees (but you can hire independent workers if they can send you an invoice, or via [SMart](http://smartbe.be/en/)).
